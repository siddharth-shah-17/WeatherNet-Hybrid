# Training Process Documentation

## üéØ Training Overview

The Advanced Weather Prediction Model training process employs modern deep learning best practices, incorporating sophisticated optimization techniques, regularization methods, and monitoring systems to ensure robust model development.

## üèóÔ∏è Training Architecture

### Model Configuration
```python
class WeatherPredictor:
    def __init__(self, sequence_length=168, prediction_horizon=24):
        self.sequence_length = 168        # 7 days of input data
        self.prediction_horizon = 24      # 24 hours prediction
        self.scalers = {}                 # Feature scalers
        self.model = None                 # Keras model
        self.history = None               # Training history
```

### Training Parameters
| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Sequence Length** | 168 hours | 7 days of historical weather data |
| **Prediction Horizon** | 24 hours | Forecast length |
| **Batch Size** | 32 | Training batch size |
| **Initial Learning Rate** | 0.001 | Adam optimizer learning rate |
| **Validation Split** | 20% | Validation data percentage |
| **Max Epochs** | 100 | Maximum training epochs |

## üîß Optimization Strategy

### 1. Adam Optimizer Configuration
```python
optimizer = Adam(
    learning_rate=0.001,
    beta_1=0.9,          # Exponential decay rate for 1st moment
    beta_2=0.999,        # Exponential decay rate for 2nd moment  
    epsilon=1e-7         # Small constant for numerical stability
)
```

**Rationale for Adam**:
- Adaptive learning rates for each parameter
- Momentum-based updates for faster convergence
- Robust to noisy gradients in time series data
- Efficient memory usage compared to second-order methods

### 2. Loss Function: Huber Loss
```python
loss = 'huber'  # Huber loss function
```

**Mathematical Definition**:
```
L_Œ¥(y, f(x)) = {
    ¬Ω(y - f(x))¬≤                    if |y - f(x)| ‚â§ Œ¥
    Œ¥|y - f(x)| - ¬ΩŒ¥¬≤              otherwise
}
```

**Advantages**:
- **Robust to Outliers**: Less sensitive than MSE to extreme weather events
- **Smooth Gradient**: Maintains gradient flow better than MAE
- **Weather-Appropriate**: Handles both normal and extreme weather conditions

### 3. Regularization Techniques

#### Dropout Layers
```python
# Different dropout rates for different layers
Dropout(0.3)  # Heavy regularization in dense layers
Dropout(0.2)  # Moderate regularization in CNN/LSTM
Dropout(0.1)  # Light regularization in final layers
```

#### Batch Normalization
```python
BatchNormalization()  # Applied after each major layer
```

**Benefits**:
- Stabilizes training dynamics
- Reduces internal covariate shift
- Enables higher learning rates
- Acts as implicit regularization

#### Recurrent Dropout
```python
LSTM(units, dropout=0.2, recurrent_dropout=0.2)
```

**Purpose**:
- Prevents overfitting in temporal connections
- Maintains LSTM's memory capabilities
- Specific to recurrent architectures

## üìä Training Callbacks

### 1. Early Stopping
```python
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=15,           # Wait 15 epochs before stopping
    restore_best_weights=True,
    verbose=1
)
```

### 2. Model Checkpointing
```python
model_checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(
    'best_weather_model.keras',
    monitor='val_loss',
    save_best_only=True,
    save_weights_only=False,
    verbose=1
)
```

### 3. Learning Rate Reduction
```python
reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(
    monitor='val_loss',
    factor=0.5,           # Reduce LR by half
    patience=8,           # Wait 8 epochs before reduction
    min_lr=1e-6,          # Minimum learning rate
    verbose=1
)
```

## üìà Training Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation Phase
```python
def prepare_training_data(self, df):
    """Complete data preparation pipeline"""
    
    # 1. Preprocess raw data
    features, targets, feature_cols, target_cols = self.preprocess_data(df)
    
    # 2. Create time series sequences
    X, y = self.create_sequences(features, targets)
    
    # 3. Split into train/validation sets
    X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, shuffle=False
    )
    
    return X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val
```

### 2. Model Compilation
```python
def compile_model(self, model):
    """Compile model with optimized settings"""
    model.compile(
        optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
        loss='huber',
        metrics=['mae', 'mse']
    )
    return model
```

### 3. Training Execution
```python
def train_model(self, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val):
    """Execute training with monitoring"""
    
    history = self.model.fit(
        X_train, y_train,
        validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
        epochs=100,
        batch_size=32,
        callbacks=[
            early_stopping,
            model_checkpoint,
            reduce_lr
        ],
        verbose=1
    )
    
    return history
```

## üìä Training Metrics

### Primary Metrics
1. **Training Loss (Huber)**: Main optimization target
2. **Validation Loss**: Generalization indicator
3. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Prediction accuracy
4. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Penalty for large errors

### Monitoring Strategy
```python
# Track multiple metrics simultaneously
metrics_to_monitor = [
    'loss',           # Training loss
    'val_loss',       # Validation loss
    'mae',            # Training MAE
    'val_mae',        # Validation MAE
    'mse',            # Training MSE
    'val_mse'         # Validation MSE
]
```

## üîç Training Analysis

### Learning Curves
The training process generates comprehensive learning curves to monitor:

1. **Loss Curves**: Training vs validation loss over epochs
2. **Metric Curves**: MAE and MSE evolution
3. **Learning Rate Schedule**: Automatic adjustments over time

### Convergence Patterns
Healthy training should show:
- **Decreasing Loss**: Both training and validation loss decrease
- **Converging Metrics**: Training and validation metrics converge
- **Stable Learning**: No significant oscillations

### Overfitting Detection
Warning signs include:
- **Diverging Loss**: Validation loss increases while training loss decreases
- **Metric Gap**: Large gap between training and validation metrics
- **Unstable Validation**: High variance in validation metrics

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Training Issues

### Identified Problems

1. **Overfitting Symptoms**:
   - Negative R¬≤ scores (-15,517 for temperature)
   - Extremely high MAPE values (74M%+ for temperature)
   - Model performs worse than baseline predictions

2. **Data Quality Issues**:
   - Training on synthetic/generated data
   - Lack of real-world weather variability
   - Insufficient data diversity

3. **Model Complexity**:
   - Over-parameterized for available data
   - Complex architecture may not be justified
   - Insufficient regularization

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Mathematical Perspective
```python
# R¬≤ Score Formula
R¬≤ = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)

# When R¬≤ is negative:
# SS_res > SS_tot
# Model predictions are worse than mean baseline
```

Negative R¬≤ indicates the model is performing worse than simply predicting the mean value for all cases.

#### MAPE Analysis
```python
# MAPE Formula
MAPE = (1/n) * Œ£|actual - predicted| / |actual| * 100%

# Extremely high MAPE suggests:
# 1. Scale mismatch between actual and predicted values
# 2. Model outputs are far from realistic ranges
# 3. Normalization issues
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Training Improvements

### 1. Data Quality Enhancement

def improve_data_quality():
    """Strategies for better training data"""
    
    # Use real meteorological data

    # Implement data validation
    validate_physical_constraints()
    remove_impossible_combinations()
    add_weather_event_diversity()
```

### 2. Model Architecture Simplification

def create_simpler_model():
    """Simplified architecture to prevent overfitting"""
    
    # Reduce model complexity
    model = Sequential([
        LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
        Dropout(0.3),
        LSTM(32),
        Dropout(0.2),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.2),
        Dense(prediction_horizon * n_features)
    ])
    
    return model
```

### 3. Enhanced Regularization
```python
def add_regularization():
    """Comprehensive regularization strategy"""
    
    # L1/L2 regularization
    from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l1_l2
    
    Dense(64, activation='relu', 
          kernel_regularizer=l1_l2(l1=1e-5, l2=1e-4))
    
    # Gradient clipping
    optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001, clipnorm=1.0)
    
    # Cross-validation
    implement_time_series_cv()
```
